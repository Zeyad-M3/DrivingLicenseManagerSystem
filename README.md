Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD) System

Overview

✅ Welcome to the DVLD System! This is a fully functional, end-to-end application designed to manage the issuance, renewal, and administration of driving licenses and related services. Built from scratch by me, this project delivers a complete solution for the Driving & Vehicle License Department.

Project Structure

📋 The application is developed using a robust 3-layer architecture, and I have single-handedly implemented every aspect:





Data Layer: A comprehensive relational database schema with tables, relationships, and populated data.



Business Logic Layer: Core processing logic for managing all workflows, from applications to license issuance.



Presentation Layer: A user-friendly interface for seamless user interaction.



Populated the database with all necessary data, ensuring accuracy and completeness.



Developed the full program, including business logic for license management and a complete user interface. This system is a testament to my effort, built from the ground up without any external modifications.
